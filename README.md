# Project-Anime-Recommender-System
The animation market has grown significantly, with more than 200 pieces of animation annually, reaching about 1.8 trillion yen. The popularity of anime, such as "Hajj", affected regional industries and local governments. About 30 % of the industry market is shared through external sales, and animation is the largest share in the value of exporting the contents of Japanese broadcasting. To address this, the animation work recommendation is proposed called "Anireco". This system aims to easily help users find animation corresponding to their preferences, identify the animation items they prefer, and enhance their interest in relevant content. Anime has become a common choice for the masses, as databases and databases provide access to various types of anime and different eras. To address this, an effective recommendation system must be developed to provide relevant and related content for anime lovers, allowing them to easily choose anime that corresponds to their preferences and preferences.
